Choose flowers with different shapes, colors, and textures to create a gorgeous new feature. Plant greenery among them so the garden stays pretty after the blooms have gone for the summer. Flowers do not require strict soil conditions like vegetables do, and they don't take quite as much ongoing care.\nIf you don't have a lot of space, you can still grow a wonderful garden. Consider  growing herbs, which can look beautiful.

Aside from sun, take the following into account:\nChoose an area with good drainage. If you see a puddle of standing water after it rains, the soil there probably has clay or rocks that are preventing the water from draining well. This isn't good for the roots of many types of plants. If the soil conditions aren't ideal, you can always build a raised bed and fill it with nutrient-rich, well drained soil instead.\nConsider the aesthetic you're going for. Plant it within view of your home's windows if you want to be able to see it from inside. Plant it in an area away from trees that drop a lot of leaves, so it will be easier to keep neat and trim. Also darker soil tends to be the better soil for plants.\nIt's easier to garden on flat land, but planting on a hill is also just fine and can have a very pretty effect. It's also possible to level a sloping garden if you wish. Choose an area without a lot of roots and rocks, so the soil won't be too difficult to till. You can have rocks and roots when you start but you must get the roots and rocks out immediately.\nConsider the location in regards to how you will use and visit it.

You should also check and see that the post is level, straight up and down.\nIdeally, a 4-foot (1.22 m) tall gate needs a 5\" x 5\" (12.7cm x 12.7 cm) redwood post. A 6-foot (1.83 m) tall gate requires a 6\" x 6\" (15.3 cm x 15.3 m) post. Post length should be at least 1\/3rd longer than the planned height of gate.

Post should be buried at least 1\/3 but preferably 1\/2 of its length and hole should be 3 x as wide as post. Concrete is best for filling hole but gravel or tightly packed earth may have to do. It is best to seal the end of post being buried using old motor oil, water proofing agent, bronzing (lightly charring post) or exterior paint. Giving buried end of post some form of water proofing protection will greatly extend life of post. Post should also be (proved) before using. Proving is allowing post to lay exposed to elements for at least 4 or more days to assure that it won't warp or twist (the longer the better, 2 weeks is best). This is especially important for 'treated' posts that have been bundled (unbundle, separate posts and allow to dry and wait to see if they will remain straight -proving).
